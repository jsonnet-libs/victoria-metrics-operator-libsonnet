## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of VLogs

## obj metadata

"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts
withAnnotations(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)
```

"Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only."

### fn metadata.withDeletionTimestamp

```ts
withDeletionTimestamp(deletionTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn metadata.withFinalizersMixin

```ts
withFinalizersMixin(finalizers)

### fn metadata.withGenerateName

```ts
withGenerateName(generateName)
```

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified.

### fn metadata.withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

"Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation.

More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces"

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferences

```ts
withOwnerReferences(ownerReferences)

Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency"

### fn metadata.withSelfLink

```ts
withSelfLink(selfLink)
```

"SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.\n\nDEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release."

### fn metadata.withUid

```ts
withUid(uid)
```

"UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.\n\nPopulated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids"

## obj spec.tolerations

"Tolerations If specified, the pod's tolerations."

### fn spec.tolerations.withEffect

```ts
withEffect(effect)
```

"Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.\nWhen specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute."

### fn spec.tolerations.withKey

```ts
withKey(key)
```

"Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.\nIf the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys."

### fn spec.tolerations.withOperator

```ts
withOperator(operator)
```

"Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.\nValid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.\nExists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can\ntolerate all taints of a particular category."

### fn spec.tolerations.withTolerationSeconds

```ts
withTolerationSeconds(tolerationSeconds)
```

"TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be\nof effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,\nit is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and\nnegative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system."

### fn spec.tolerations.withValue

```ts
withValue(value)
```

"Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.\nIf the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string."

```

"Path within the container at which the volume should be mounted.  Must\nnot contain ':'."

### fn spec.volumeMounts.withMountPropagation

```ts

```

"mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host\nto container and the other way around.\nWhen not set, MountPropagationNone is used.\nThis field is beta in 1.10.\nWhen RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified\n(which defaults to None)."

### fn spec.volumeMounts.withName

```ts

"Mounted read-only if true, read-write otherwise (false or unspecified).\nDefaults to false."

### fn spec.volumeMounts.withRecursiveReadOnly

```ts
withRecursiveReadOnly(recursiveReadOnly)
```

"RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled\nrecursively.\n\nIf ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.\n\nIf ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made\nrecursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made\nrecursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this\nfield is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is\nsupported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and\nan error will be generated to indicate the reason.\n\nIf this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to\nNone (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).\n\nIf this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled."

### fn spec.volumeMounts.withSubPath

```ts
withSubPath(subPath)
```

"Path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted.\nDefaults to \"\" (volume's root)."

### fn spec.volumeMounts.withSubPathExpr

```ts
withSubPathExpr(subPathExpr)
```

"Expanded path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted.\nBehaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment.\nDefaults to \"\" (volume's root).\nSubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive."
